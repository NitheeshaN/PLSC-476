PLSC 497: Analyzing the American Presidency

Course Instructor: Professor Eleanor Schiff
Teaching Asisstant: Nitheesha Nakka

Course Description
The word “presidency” may conjure up thoughts of powdered wigs, secret service agents, or inspirational speeches.  Whatever the specific images, much of what we associate with the presidency centers on the person behind the desk: the man or woman elected to serve as commander in chief of the United States, each with a unique set of goals, skills, experience, perspective, and idiosyncrasies that he or she brings to the job. The presidency, however, is also an institution, much larger than the human being who occupies the office. No matter who the president is, the executive branch of government is endowed with a particular set of institutional powers and constraints that help provide and limit the president’s ability to fulfill his or her agenda. Moreover, no presidency occurs in a vacuum. Each administration is indelibly influenced by the political, social, and economic conditions of that president’s time in office. The balance between 1) the presidency as an individual entity (i.e., a person), 2) the presidency as an institution, and finally 3) the context of the time in which the presidency occurs, will form the central theme of our semester long study.

Broadly, this course is divided into topical units that touch on different aspects of the presidency as both an institution and as a person.  We will begin by investigating the foundations of the office – what the framers intended when they created the presidency during the Constitutional Convention in 1787, and how the presidency has evolved over time not only from extensions of individual occupants but also delegation from the Congress.  The modern presidency as an institution has become the most powerful political office in the world today.  We will also discuss how political scientists study the institution of the presidency and the challenges it presents for researchers.  Further, we will also study different approaches to governing that stems from the personality of individual occupants and also the constraints and opportunities that the office enables for governance.  We will discuss what a presidential campaign entails and how much power the major political parties exert in choosing a nominee.  Lastly, we will discuss inter-branch relationships between the Congress, the bureaucracy, the public, the media, and interest groups as they relate to the presidency and governance.
